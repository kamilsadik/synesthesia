# Synesthesia

To run the Synesthesia generative algorithm:
- Clone this repo
- Populate the output directory with .wav files, naming each file "ARTIST_SONG.wav"
- Run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook

To further customize your output, you can adjust parameters in cell 2 of the Jupyter Notebook, and even create your own color palette by adding to the *palettes* dictionary.
