# Synesthesia

To run the Synesthesia generative algorithm:
- Clone this repo
- Populate the *wav_files* directory with .wav files, using the naming convention, "ARTIST_SONG.wav"
- Run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook

A variety of Synesthesia variations for each song will be saved in the *output* directory. Each output file has an associated json with details about the parameters used to generate that piece.

To further customize your output, you can adjust parameters in cell 2 of the Jupyter Notebook, and even create your own color palette by adding to the *palettes* dictionary.
